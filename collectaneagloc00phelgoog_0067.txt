While Angels with regret look down

To see you spum a heavenly crown t
Th’ Eternal God calls from above,

And Jesus pleads his bleeding love3
Awaken’d conscience gives you pain,

And shall they join their pleas in vain t

cester, by a Lady in the Collega.

Life is the time to serve the Lord,

The time t'insure the great reward,

And while the lamp holds out to burn,

The vilest sinner may return.

Lise is the hour that God has given

To ’scape from hell, and fly to heaven-

The day of grace, and mortale may

Secure the blessings of the day.—

Then what my thoughts assign to do,

My hands with all your might pursue,

Since no device nor work is found,

Nor Faith, nor Hope, beneath the ground.

There are no acts of pardon pass’d

In the cold grave to which we haste ς

But darkness death and long despair

Reign iu eternal silence there.
